# The weather app

## "Retrieving data by means of an API"

The challenge includes making an app to display the current weather and the forecast of 5 days by means of retrieving data from an API. This data is shown in json and will be converted to be usable in the JavaScript file.

  + Final styling
  + Getting dates in place
  + Make the input dummy-proof
  + Have an error default message
  + Protect the API-keys by having them out of the public file
